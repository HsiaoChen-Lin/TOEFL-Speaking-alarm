# TOEFL-Speaking-alarm
It is a little bit annoying to always open websites such as KMF to have TOEFL practice test (though the website is really helpful and I love it), the reasons are:

1. Sometimes it will shutdown or I can not record or see the alarm
2. There is no reset button so I always need to wait if I am not satisfied with my recording

Therefor, I use TKinter and some module to create my own TOEFL speaking alarm. Hope this can help you too!

### Installation

```python
pip install Pillow
pip install tk
```

### User Interface

### Future Work

1. Add sound (included in files)
2. Recording
3. Put on website
